# Python & Flask

I did a small hair salon booking form to submit.
After the booking has been made the data will appear in the database with sqlite and DB browser for sqlite.
The user will see the details of his booking after submitting. In the return for the submission I used "booking=data" to display the booking after submitting

The user can see all the bookings that is in the database by clicking on the button "All bookings", there I use for loop to display all bookings

For styling I used Bootstrap and deployed the app with Heroku
